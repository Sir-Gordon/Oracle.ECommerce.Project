# Oracle.ECommerce.Project

Using SQL DEVELOPER, this project helps setup an E-COMMERCE database to track objects from Sellers to Order history from Customers. 

To setup download the files and run the statements in the SQL file. 
Then import data from each CSV to their respective tables. CSV filenames correspond with the database table names.
